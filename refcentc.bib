title = {Evolution of Centromeric Retrotransposons in Grasses},
year = {2014}, 
doi = {10.1093/gbe/evu096}, 
abstract ={Centromeric Retrotransposons (CR) constitute a family of plant retroelements, some of which have the ability to target their insertion almost exclusively to the functional centromeres. Our exhaustive analysis of CR family members in four grass genomes revealed not only horizontal transfer (HT) of CR elements between the oryzoid and panicoid grass lineages, but also their subsequent recombination with endogenous elements that in some cases created prolific recombinants in foxtail millet and sorghum. HT events are easily identifiable only in cases where host genome divergence significantly predates horizontal transfer, thus documented HT events likely represent only a fraction of the total. If the more difficult to detect ancient HT events occurred at frequencies similar to those observable in present day grasses, the extant LTR retrotransposons represent the mosaic products of horizontal transfer and recombination that are optimized for retrotransposition in their host genomes. This complicates not only phylogenetic analysis, but also the establishment of a meaningful retrotransposon nomenclature, which we have nevertheless attempted to implement here. In contrast to the plant-centric naming convention used currently for CR elements, we classify elements primarily based on their phylogenetic relationships regardless of host plant, using the exhaustively studied maize elements assigned to six different subfamilies as a standard. The CR2 subfamily is the most widely distributed of the six CR subfamilies discovered in grass genomes to date and thus the most likely to play a functional role at grass centromeres.},

A DNA hybridization blot panel of eight individual maize chromosome addition lines revealed that 180-bp repeats found in knobs are present in each of these maize chromosomes, but the copy number varies from \~100 to 25,000. Cosmid clones with knob DNA segments were isolated from a genomic library of an oat-maize chromosome 9 addition line with the help of the 180-bp knob-associated repeated DNA sequence used as a probe. Cloned knob DNA segments revealed a complex organization in which blocks of tandemly arranged 180-bp repeating units are interrupted by insertions of other repeated DNA sequences, mostly represented by individual full size copies of retrotransposable elements. There is an obvious preference for the integration of retrotransposable elements into certain sites (hot spots) of the 180-bp repeat. Sequence microheterogeneity including point mutations and duplications was found in copies of 180-bp repeats. The 180-bp repeats within an array all had the same polarity. Restriction maps constructed for 23 cloned knob DNA fragments revealed the positions of polymorphic sites and sites of integration of insertion elements.

To determine if these major centromeric DNAs are part of the functional centromere/kinetochore complex, we generated antiserum to maize centromeric histone H3 (CENH3). CENH3, a highly conserved protein that replaces histone H3 in centromeres, is thought to recruit many of the proteins required for chromosome movement. CENH3 is present throughout the cell cycle and colocalizes with the kinetochore protein CENPC in meiotic cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrates that CentC and CRM interact specifically with CENH3, whereas knob repeats and Tekay retroelements do not. Approximately 38 and 33\% of CentC and CRM are precipitated in the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, consistent with data showing that much, but not all, of CENH3 colocalizes with CentC.}, location = {}, keywords = {}}@Article{Zhang2012,author = {Zhang, Han and Dawe, R Kelly}, title = {Total centromere size and genome size are strongly correlated in ten grass species}, journal = {Chromosome Research}, volume = {20}, number = {4}, pages = {403-412}, year = {2012}, abstract = {}, location = {}, keywords = {}}@Article{Cheng2012,author = {Cheng, Feng and Wu, Jian and Fang, Lu and Sun, Silong and Liu, Bo and Lin, Ke and Bonnema, Guusje and Wang, Xiaowu}, title = {Biased Gene Fractionation and Dominant Gene Expression among the Subgenomes of <italic>Brassica rapa</italic>}, journal = {PLoS ONE PLoS ONE}, volume = {7}, number = {5}, pages = {e36442}, year = {2012}, abstract = {p>Polyploidization, both ancient and recent, is frequent among plants.

In most animals and plants that have been studied, centromeres contain megabase-scale arrays of tandem repeats. Despite their importance, very little is known about the degree to which centromere tandem repeats share common properties between different species across different phyla. We used bioinformatic methods to identify high-copy tandem repeats from 282 species using publicly available genomic sequence and our own data.RESULTS:Our methods are compatible with all current sequencing technologies. Long Pacific Biosciences sequence reads allowed us to find tandem repeat monomers up to 1,419 bp. We assumed that the most abundant tandem repeat is the centromere DNA, which was true for most species whose centromeres have been previously characterized, suggesting this is a general property of genomes. High-copy centromere tandem repeats were found in almost all animal and plant genomes, but repeat monomers were highly variable in sequence composition and length. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of sequence homology showed little evidence of sequence conservation beyond approximately 50 million years of divergence. We find that despite an overall lack of sequence conservation, centromere tandem repeats from diverse species showed similar modes of evolution.CONCLUSIONS:While centromere position in most eukaryotes is epigenetically determined, our results indicate that tandem repeats are highly prevalent at centromeres of both animal and plant genomes. This suggests a functional role for such repeats, perhaps in promoting concerted evolution of centromere DNA across chromosomes.}, location = {}, keywords = {}}@Article{Nagaki2003,author = {Nagaki, Kiyotaka and Song, Junqi and Stupar, Robert M. and Parokonny, Alexander S. and Yuan, Qiaoping and Ouyang, Shu and Liu, Jia and Hsiao, Joseph and Jones, Kristine M. and Dawe, R.

Polyploidy and the expansion of repetitive DNA, primarily transposable elements, are two mechanisms that have since been found to account for this differential. While the inactivation of retrotransposons by methylation and their removal from the genome by illegitimate recombination have been well documented, the cause of the apparently periodic bursts of retrotranposon expansion is as yet unknown. We show that the expansion of the CRM1 retrotransposon subfamily in the ancient allotetraploid crop plant corn is linked to the repeated formation of novel recombinant elements derived from two parental retrotransposon genotypes, which may have been brought together during the hybridization of two sympatric species that make up the present day corn genome, thus revealing a unique mechanism linking polyploidy and retrotransposition.}, location = {}, keywords = {}}

Analysis of six cosmid clones containing centromeric DNA segments revealed a complex organization.

Two of the six cosmid clones contained regions composed of a newly identified family of tandem repeats, termed CentC. Copies of CentA and tandem arrays of CentC are interspersed with other repetitive elements, including the previously identified maize retroelements Huck and Prem2. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that CentC and CentA elements are limited to the centromeric region of each maize chromosome. The retroelements Huck and Prem2 are dispersed along all maize chromosomes, although Huck elements are present in an increased concentration around centromeric regions. Significant variation in the size of the blocks of CentC and in the copy number of CentA elements, as well as restriction fragment length variations were detected within the centromeric region of each maize chromosome studied. The different proportions and arrangements of these elements and likely others provide each centromeric region with a unique overall structure.}, location = {}, keywords = {}}@Article{Hanson1996,author = {Hanson, Michael A. and Gaut, Brandon S. and Stec, Adrian O. and Fuerstenberg, Susan I. and Goodman, Major M. and Coe, Edward H. and Doebley, John F.}, title = {Evolution of Anthocyanin Biosynthesis in Maize Kernels: The Role of Regulatory and Enzymatic Loci}, journal = {Genetics}, volume = {143}, number = {3}, pages = {1395-1407}, year = {1996}, abstract = {Understanding which genes contribute to evolutionary change and the nature of the alterations in them are fundamental challenges in evolution. We analyzed regulatory and enzymatic genes in the maize anthocyanin pathway as related to the evolution of anthocyanin-pigmented kernels in maize from colorless kernels of its progenitor, teosinte. Genetic tests indicate that teosinte possesses functional alleles at all enzymatic loci. At two regulatory loci, most teosintes possess alleles that encode functional proteins, but ones that are not expressed during kernel development and not capable of activating anthocyanin biosynthesis there. We investigated nucleotide polymorphism at one of the regulatory loci, c1. Several observations suggest that c1 has not evolved in a strictly neutral manner, including an exceptionally low level of polymorphism and a biased representation of haplotypes in maize. Curiously, sequence data show that most of our teosinte samples possess a promoter element necessary for the activation of the anthocyanin pathway during kernel development, although genetic tests indicate that teosinte c1 alleles are not active during kernel development. Our analyses suggest that the evolution of the purple kernels resulted from changes in cis regulatory elements at regulatory loci and not changes in either regulatory protein function nor the enzymatic loci.}, location = {}, keywords = {}}@Article{ReinhartBartel2002,author = {Reinhart, Brenda J. and Bartel, David P.}, title = {Small RNAs Correspond to Centromere Heterochromatic Repeats}, journal = {Science}, volume = {297}, number = {5588}, pages = {1831-1831}, year = {2002}, abstract = {}, location = {}, keywords = {}}

With the recent development of methods to distinguish each of the 10 pairs of homologues in somatic root tip spreads, a wide collection of maize lines was subjected to karyotype analysis to serve as a reference for the community and to examine the spectrum of chromosomal features in the species. The core nested association mapping progenitor collection and additional selections of diversity lines were examined. Commonly used inbred lines were included in the analysis. The centromere 4 specific repeat and ribosomal RNA loci were invariant. The CentC centromere repeat exhibited extensive differences in quantity on any particular chromosome across lines. Knob heterochromatin was highly variable with locations at many sites in the genome. Lastly, representative examples from other species in the genus Zea (teosintes) were examined, which provide information on the evolution of chromosomal features.},

We examined the chromosomal consequences of genomic merger in Arabidopsis suecica, the allotetraploid hybrid of Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis arenosa. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with centromere, nucleolus organizer region (NOR), and 5S rRNA gene probes reveals the expected numbers of progenitor chromosomes in natural A. suecica, but one pair of A. thaliana NORs and one pair of A. arenosa-derived 5S gene loci are missing. Similarly, in newly formed synthetic A. suecica-like allotetraploids, pairs of A. thaliana NORs are gained de novo, lost, and/or transposed to A. arenosa chromosomes, with genotypic differences apparent between F3 siblings of the same F2 parent and between independent lines. Likewise, pairs of A. arenosa 5S genes are lost and novel linkages between 5S loci and NORs arise in synthetic allotetraploids. By contrast, the expected numbers of A. arenosa-derived NORs and A. thaliana-derived 5S loci are found in both natural and synthetic A. suecica. Collectively, these observations suggest that some, but not all, loci are unstable in newly formed A. suecica allotetraploids and can participate in a variety of alternative rearrangements, some of which resemble chromosomal changes found in nature.}, location = {}, keywords = {}}@article{poggio1998,

Maize has undergone a particularly striking transformation. Researchers have sought for decades to identify the genes underlying maize evolution, but these efforts have been limited in scope. Here, we report a comprehensive assessment of the evolution of modern maize based on the genome-wide resequencing of 75 wild, landrace and improved maize lines. We find evidence of recovery of diversity after domestication, likely introgression from wild relatives, and evidence for stronger selection during domestication than improvement. We identify a number of genes with stronger signals of selection than those previously shown to underlie major morphological changes. Finally, through transcriptome-wide analysis of gene expression, we find evidence both consistent with removal of cis-acting variation during maize domestication and improvement and suggestive of modern breeding having increased dominance in expression while targeting highly expressed genes.}, location = {1] Department of Plant Sciences, University of California, Davis, California, USA.

In order to begin a comprehensive study of TE contributions to the structure, function, and evolution of both genes and genomes, we first identified all of the TEs in maize and then investigated whether there were non-random patterns in their dispersal. We used homology and TE structure criteria in an effort to discover all of the retroelements in the recently sequenced genome from maize inbred B73. We found that the retroelements are incredibly diverse in maize, with many hundreds of families that show different insertion and/or retention specificities across the maize chromosomes. Most of these element families are present in low copy numbers and had been missed by previous searches that relied on a high-copy-number criterion. Different element families exhibited very different biases for accumulation across the chromosomes, indicating that they can detect and utilize many different chromatin environments.</p>}, location = {},
